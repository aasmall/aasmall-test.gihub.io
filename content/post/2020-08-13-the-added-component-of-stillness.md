Life can be experienced as a struggle or pressure even a burden. It seems it is
all up to us. We have to get everything done and on time. It all seems so
important and maybe even urgent. The content of our lives can be so full and
demanding with the weight of the world on our shoulders. We look forward to a
moment of reprieve and depending on our inclination we can use a beer at the end
of the day or veg out in front of the TV anything to go below thought or to
escape the demands of our thoughts. 

Through the ability to watch our thoughts objectively, an added component begins
to emerge. A deep sense of stillness begins to accompany all we do. It’s
objective, calm, always there. It has always been there, just like the sun is
always there, shining on all that is but when it is not recognized we can feel
empty or in search of the next place of comfort or place to land.

This spacious stillness creates a sense of deep comfort a sense of being okay
regardless of the situation. This added component is not judgemental or even
commenting on anything. It is like never being alone. It is like being in the
eye of the hurricane. Jesus called it the peace that passes all understanding.

Please let me know if you would like support in realizing this still place.
