I will be in CA, Sebastopol/Santa Rosa area second week in March. Please read on
and/or pass the word to anyone you think may benefit from this support. Please
contact me.

Join me in learning to self-love so completely that the pathway to our highest
good is inevitable. It isn’t easy to love ourselves through the deepest, most
profound emotions but the road less traveled can bring everything it appears we
would get from frantically efforting to fulfill every desire and accomplish
every goal. End the cycle of pushing ahead to some grass is greener on the other
side and collapsing into a puddle of exhaustion from defeat and resulting
apathy. It is an art to learn the power of your center, to be fully present in
every moment as it arises in all its perfection.

I know we will enjoy our time together.

Love and many blessing,

Carol Small
