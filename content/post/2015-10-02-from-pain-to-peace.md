My programming from child hood was running, acting, pretending, overriding
relentless fear, hysterical fear of separation and neglect….fear of death by
abandonment first by others then by myself. A life time of feeling unsafe,
unwanted and scared of the manifestations that created every day. I have acted
and reacted, tried and given up over and over.

**My life was an effort to heal, transform to the point of obsession, trying to
break free of guilt and shame for all the ways I have used others to be safe,
secure and to matter. The harm I have caused and the continuation of this false
information, spreading it like a virus.**

In order to heal I had to face annihilation of all my strategies to deny my
terror of life.  Stop running and just realize this isn’t me.  This is my
programming, my indoctrination, my legacy.  That is the good news. I am not
stuck with this fear. It is not the truth. I wonder why this was so hard, why it
took so long to wake up to the realization this isn’t personal. All the ways I
didn’t like me was because I was doing all the things that seemed the solution
to my fear. But that wasn't me, it was the story passed down through
generations. Information that I mistook for me. No strategy would ever work.  I
just stop, face it, relax and let this lie dissolve back into the void being
replaced with safety and trust and love….**the truth of who I am.**

**There are ways and steps to this process from pain to peace. I want to share
them with all who are courageously ready to be free.**
