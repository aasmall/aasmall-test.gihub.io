This takes courage but when we relax deeply during a very strong feeling and
face it, our awareness can release the glue that holds the feeling in place,
allowing the story, thought or situation that was attached to the feeling to
dissolve back into its true natureâ€¦ nothingness. Then we can see the truth of
the moment untainted by the past and imagined future. This acceptance for just a
moment relaxes the body, freeing the mind.

The challenge then becomes how do we relax deeply when we default into gripping
onto or against, wishing the strong feeling would go away? Who we are is more
than a feeling, a thought or a memory. When we experience that a feeling, a
thought, or a memory is that which rests on us, this growing awareness gives
that courage to stop habitual, pain-producing feelings and scenarios and brings
peace. This of course requires TRUST, and building of trust is a process I would
love to help you incorporate into everyday life.
