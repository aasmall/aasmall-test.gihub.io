It isn’t easy to break out of the part we play in the family dynamic. It can be
buried until we are hit by a devastating blow to a family member. A debilitating
disease or loss can bring to the surface patterns we have been challenged by our
whole lives but so elusive that until forced by the challenge, we won’t live our
own lives free of expectation to fulfill a role.

What is the part you play in your family? The hero, the responsible one, the
invisible one, the caretaker? I can give you an example: Maybe your parents were
not very present and all the brothers and sisters had to ban together forming a
sort of alliance that keeps everyone safe. The parents are so tangled in their
own lives that the drama and pain they feel leaves the children to basically
fend for themselves. This forms a deep bond between all the siblings and a sense
of responsibility for each other. This bond, as wonderful as it is, can keep
each person from moving forward with a sense of freedom and individuality, able
to fulfill their full potential. It can be challenging to face “I’m holding
myself back so I don’t threaten the expectations of the group.” “Will they still
love me if I change and move in a different direction?” “Can I be okay if I move
away from the protective cocoon of their belief structures?”

The beauty of facing our limitations is that we can then realize that loyalty to
old programming can be seen as actually obsolete, no longer relevant. That is
the beginning of choice, real choice and the love for each other can actually
expand and grow to include more wonderful possibilities.

Once faced, old outdated expectations begin to clear and the freedom to be
different is actually an addition to, not the fear-based threat it once seemed.
The old appearance is cleared and replaced with freedom to BE, fear of, and loss
replaced with trust and open-hearted acceptance of each other's differences.

If this speaks to you. Then please contact me and we will work together for your
freedom.
