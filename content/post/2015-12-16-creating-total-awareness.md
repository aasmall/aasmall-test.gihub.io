It is not easy to be totally aware.  It is not easy to look at anything in a
total way.  We are not used to it.  No one has taught us the way of effortless
awareness.

We do not know how to live in emptiness.  Every moment of our waking hours, is
filled with ego-centred activities.  I would suggest that a person interested in
meditation spend some time every day in complete silence.  One has to begin with
abstention of physical and psychological action.  In the beginning one should
try to follow the rhythm of breathing.  The support of the rhythm can be used to
divert attention from 'thought-memory-response-process.'

A calmness prevails when the attention is turned inwards.  A relaxation is
experienced when the thought-process comes to an end.

The first impact of such experience of emptiness is mostly bewildering.  Every
other second the mind wants to imagine that something is happening.  It wants to
feel that it is getting some experience. The mind feels strangled when silence
starts operating on it.

One has to watch the movements of the mind without trying to control or suppress
it.  One has to go through the phase of suffocation, embarrassment and void.  It
is an unavoidable experience of loneliness through which everyone has to go once
in his life.
