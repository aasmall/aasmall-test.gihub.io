Hi Everybody,

Welcoming you to a support group some friends playfully named the "Caroling
Support Group."

We meet on the 4th Saturday of every month from 10:30 AM until 12:00 PM Pacific.
Payment of $25 is required in advance. We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and you may
[click here to request an invitation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caroling/join).

We start every group with a quick check in for those that want to participate
and then we will build a Qi Field to relax and center. We create space for both
individuals who want to participate actively as for those who would rather sit
quietly and learn from the experiece of others.

I lead the group by working with indivuduals who volunteer and drawing on the
threads that connect their experience with the rest of ours. You may always feel
free to ask questions about what pattern you are working on or a situation where
support is welcomed.

You will be able to mute yourself or if you want to participate with sound
and/or video.

Looking forward to being with you.

Love, Carol
