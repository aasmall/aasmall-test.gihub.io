Interacting with our loved ones can feel fraught with challenges, and heartache.
So much built-in expectations and entitlement. I have been asked why be in a
relationship if it isn’t to get my needs met? Wow, I wonder if you can realize
that actually holds the other person hostage to live their life to meet your
needs.  What if I could help you to see that love is first an inside job. What
if you knew that self-love and inner connection brings such confidence that
being together isn’t to complete you but to reflect your own self-connection.
Imagine a relationship that was free of obligation and expectation. Such deep
comfort.

Have you noticed it seems like the same problems come up time and time again and
no matter how many times we talk it out?  No matter how hard we try to find the
solution to create harmony and peace and connection that we crave? We complain,
negotiate, plea, process all to get understood and we try desperately to run
from old wounds. Old wounding can leave us with such feelings of inadequacy.
Those old wounds can heal.

Have you noticed when you need the other person to validate your existence or
make you matter you give them all the power over your right to BE? Do you need
their permission? But if I don’t do what they want they may leave me.  Maybe
they will, we can’t control that, but you will attract a better relationship
when you appreciate yourself without giving yourself away. Hurt and wanting
overtake any chance of happiness, and we are left feeling empty. That is called
Self Abandonment. Imagine being in a relationship already happy.

What if I were to tell you the solution comes when we allow and accept the
feeling of hurt, longing or wanting for just 10 seconds, face it, let your own
awareness bring you home to yourself, and replace it with self-trust. Then
identify the thought-form that creates the unrest? Is it even true? Or is it
some old learned outdated thought. This will change our relationships directly
and the hope to have the love, peace, and harmony that is our birthright.

The most valuable use of this life for me is to support the real change of
suffering into deep comfort.
