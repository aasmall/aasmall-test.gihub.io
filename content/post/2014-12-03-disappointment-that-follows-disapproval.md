Received the class evaluations back.  They weren't great.  I feel disappointed & sad.  I sense where the learning experience is and yet I feel, well now I feel just numb because I don't want to feel anything.

Oh yes, there it is, fear, fear.

Funny because I realized that grad school was not the place for me to teach and yet ...

Many fears.   Some anger, frustration.  Grief.  Need to leave to get to Berkeley.

Worry.

Confusion.  At another school, the students really enjoyed my teaching!

Jaw clenching.  Deep breath out.  Another.

Shame.

Been working a lot lately with the disappointment and sadness that follows disapproval or mostly the different view points that can just be the reflection of a different consciousness or perception. It is easy to be devastated by it even though it is impossible to be cut from the same cloth.

I had a situation where I was very judged or made very wrong by someone and as I was quiet and when I looked deeper they had such a polarized life. They said they needed to have this kind of "relief" from an overly obligated and responsible pressured life that they needed the other extreme of completely having time of no obligation or feelings of being responsible. The polarized reality didn't match my lack of desire for either side.  Long story short. There was no way they could see out of their particular box. I was never going to be seen in any other light than an invasive, needy, bitch. There perspective had to see me that way. It was awful to be seen in such a horrible light but with their belief system there was no other way.  They are right for them and I was right for me.  What if you are always right. Always in the right place at the right time, saying the perfect thing, doing the perfect thing and there were no need to improve or "be better". What if it is not personal, you? What if it is the movement of god that is not to be judged? The lesson here is how can I allow the perception of others to be what they are and

really know they can in no way be personal?  That is never easy but it can help to at least have the awareness that to get approval is hopeless.

Thank you dear for sharing so deeply.
