## How you end the day makes all the difference

Your evening routine can either set you up for a cheerful and fulfilling day or
one full of frustration and exhaustion. Here are **seven steps you can take to
create a successful bedtime routine** that will give you more restful nights and
more productive days.

### 1. Set an alarm for bedtime

Try setting an alarm for one hour before you’d like to be settled in bed to
remind you that it’s time to step out of your day and start winding down.

### 2. Drink up

Since you end up going 6–8 hours without any liquid at all, drinking water
throughout the day and before you hit the sack is essential to keeping
yourself hydrated. Try adding[Lavender Vitality™ essential
oil](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/lavender-vitality-5ml) to
your water or herbal tea for a calming influence. Aim for an hour before
bed, so you aren’t waking up in the middle of the night for a bathroom trip.

### 3. Give yourself a little face time

Make sure to give your skin and teeth the TLC they need. Refresh and renew
your face with a mild wash such as our [ART® Gentle
Cleanser](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/art-gentle-cleanser-120ml).
You should also use gentle products on your teeth that are free of synthetic
dyes and fluoride such as our [Thieves® AromaBright™
Toothpaste](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/thieves-aromabright-toothpaste)
and [Thieves Fresh Essence
Mouthwash](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/thieves-fresh-essence-mouthwash).
Taking time to establish and follow this important hygiene ritual will help
you feel fresh and relaxed before bed and can signal to your brain that it’s
time to calm down.

### 4. Take notes for tomorrow

Write down a brief game plan for a productive tomorrow. While creating your
list, remember to envision the kind of day you’d like to have, how you’d
like to feel, and the top priorities you’ve got in your sights. Get it down
on paper and you won’t spend hours trying to fall asleep thinking about what
your day might look like.

### 5. Set yourself up for success

The night before, prepare your outfit, your breakfast and lunch, or complete
other tasks you’d usually take care of in the morning. The fewer tasks
looming over you, the quicker and happier you will be getting out of bed in
the morning.

### 6. Ditch the tech and read a book

The light from electronic screens can trick your mind and body into thinking
it’s still light out. Try leaving technology out of your bedroom to help you
shift into to a calm, relaxed, and clear state.

### 7. Add essential oils to your routine

Try diffusing
[Lavender](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/lavender-essential-oil),
[Stress Away™](https://www.youngliving.com/en_US/products/stress-away-essential-oil),
or your favorite blend of essential oils with comforting aromas as you
prepare for bed. Rubbing a couple drops between your palms and brushing them
over your pillow can also boost the relaxing aromas and can make jumping
into a cloud of pillows and blankets feel extra luxurious.

Once you’ve worked out a routine that helps you sleep well on a regular basis,
_create a ritual of those steps so your body and mind is prepared for a good
sleep and a successful day ahead_.
