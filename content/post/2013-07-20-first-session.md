I've heard from many people who I've worked with that they were initially
uncertian about what it would feel like to work with me. To help alleviate that
anxiety, I wanted to share what that experience is like.

After speaking with you for a few moments, I zero in with laser beam action on
your core issue. Embracing, honoring the resisted parts will simply pave the
road to clear disabling beliefs holding you back from reaching all your hopes and
dreams--your natural state, your full potential. This will allow you to quickly
dissolve life long debilitating patterns that keep repeating, over and over
again. As faulty perceptions drop, you will recover your peace of mind,
reaching your natural state of imperturbability, strength and confidence.

My work is based on the assumption that joy is our natural state of being and
that all suffering comes from resisting what is, and false programming we
mistake for who we are. The purpose of the process is to discover the divinity
within oneself and learn to be free from the past memories that hinder your
happiness in the present moment.

I tend to focus our energy in a few common areas

- Forget therapy and the constant rehashing of feeling and stories. It only
  takes a second to identify a reactive moment to stop and reprogram repetitive,
  hitting head against the wall, ongoing struggle.
- Find a balance between self care and responsibility. Learn how striving
  actually hinders and slows down progress.
- Heal the deep sadness that holds you hostage.
- Experience real change and drop your old identity. With only a few sessions,
  you can learn to discover the more you want, the less you get. Through your
  willingness to challenge the minds insistence on pushing to get what you want,
  you can learn by letting go that it is naturally yours. Allow me to show you
  how to give up quickly old programs that have stubbornly held you hostage, and
  you will be able to command your environment with your power of center.

I'll leave you with a short story:

> A Sufi teaching story tells of the man who visited a great mystic to find out
> how to let go of his chains of attachment and his prejudices. Instead of
> answering him directly, the mystic jumped to his feet and bolted to a nearby
> pillar, flung his arms around it, grasping the marble surface as he screamed,
> "Save me from this pillar! Save me from this pillar!"
>
> The man who had asked the question could not believe what he saw. He thought
> the mystic was mad. The shouting soon brought a crowd of people.
>
> "Why are you doing that?" the man asked. "I came to you to ask a spiritual
> question because I thought you were wise, but obviously you are crazy. You are
> holding the pillar, the pillar is not holding you. You can simply let go."
>
> The mystic let go of the pillar and said to the man, "If you can understand
> that, you have your answers. Your chains of attachment are not holding you,
> you are holding them. You can simply let go." - Author Unknown
