## Step one

Identify notice feeling that took me away from calm.

## Step two

Ask what thought caused that feeling.

## Step three

I'm a bother is the thought. (I have to do it right or I will die, I doubt,
doubt doubt)

## Step four

Notice how destructive that thought is because it is the thought that caused the
pressured feeling.

## Step five

I am willing to take full responsibility for that destructive thought instead of
believing or responding to thought with a feeling.

## Step six

Dealing with it means to check if the feeling can still be elicited from the
thought.

Go back and forth and tell no feeling can be.

## Step seven

Replace get Calm. Calm, centered natural is a replacement also trust trust trust
relax complete.

Never doubt the results of your work simply know that it is good it is complete
and it is done.
