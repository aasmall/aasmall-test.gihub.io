Letâ€™s take a moment to reflect on perceptions. With a birds eye view open to the
awareness that we can get blindsided by perceptions based on old programming
that is circulating and often repeating.

Example: Our partner of life just tells us that he/she is moving on and out of
the relationship. Our stomach gets tights, our throat closes, and we can
experience immediate devastation, desperately wanting to run from the feeling
that was triggered by the appearance of rejection. With further allowing and
investigation what appeared to be a horrible thing steers us into inner changes
and we attract a partner that reflects our deeper connection to ourselves.

Perception CAN be recognized even at the time of a shock or change or judgement
we may assume we are correct in having. Upon further exploration, how often are
held back by our short sided point of view?
