There are patterns of the heart that can make us have self-doubt, closed to
love, feelings of self-criticism, entitlement, taking life for granted,
arrogance, and living full of judgment. If you notice that some of these traits
have been holding you hostage, then I would love to introduce you to the
antidote to these debilitating feelings. Cultivating an open heart needs to
include these qualities, Trust, openness, love, gratitude, and Gongjing (True
Respect)

These are the replacement patterns for the negative painful closed heart. We
will work together to change these patterns of the heart for a sense of peace
and calm and a new level of Joy!

See if you recognize any of these patterns of the Consciousness. Working to
clear these patterns of the mind will bring unification and balance to your
life.
