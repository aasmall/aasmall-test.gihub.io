**I Am That** **by Nisargadatta Maharaj**

_Q:  Can I think 'I am God'?_

M:  Don't identify yourself with an idea. If you mean by God the Unknown, then
you merely say: 'I do not know what I am'. If you know God as you know your
self, you need not say it. Best is the simple feeling 'I am'. Dwell on it
patiently. Here patience is wisdom; don't think of failure.There can be no
failure in this undertaking.

_Q:  My thoughts will not let me._

M:  Pay no attention. Don't fight them. Just do nothing about them, let them be,
whatever they are. Your very fighting them gives them life. Just disregard. Look
through. Remember to remember: whatever happens -- happens because I am. All
reminds you that you _are_. Take full advantage of the fact that to experience
you must _be_. You need not stop thinking. Just cease being interested. It
is disinterest that liberates. Don't hold on, that is all. The world is made of
rings. The hooks are all yours. Make straight your hooks and nothing can hold
you. Give up your addictions. There is nothing else to give up. Stop your
routine of acquisitiveness, your habit of looking for results and the freedom of
the universe is yours. Be effortless.
