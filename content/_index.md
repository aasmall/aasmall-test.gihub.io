## My work

My work is based on the assumption that joy is our natural state of being and
that our suffering comes from resisting what is, and painful programming can be
mistaken for who we are. This is the false self. This process, this art of
transformation can help allow our True Self to emerge and learn to be free from
the past memories that hinder your happiness in the present moment.

I work with everyone a little differently. But hopefully, this sample will give
you an idea.

I have an eclectic background in many healing modalities but my most-honed skill
is intuition and my ability to quickly see core issues and help you see the
issue creating the problem. I teach you about the patterns you face, and then
gently guide you to face and replace them, dissolving the illusions that keep
you stuck, and help you to live the life you want, as your True Self. 

Embracing, honoring the resisting parts will pave the road to clear disabling
beliefs holding you back from reaching all your hopes and dreams–your natural
state, your full potential. This will allow you to help to dissolve lifelong,
debilitating patterns that keep repeating, over and over again. As faulty
perceptions drop, you will recover your peace of mind, reaching your natural
state of imperturbability, strength, and confidence.

I focus energy in a few common areas

* How you feel is of course important but we can get lost in the feeling state
    that has been fueled by old debilitating thought-forms. When you take a
    moment to identify a reactive moment, to stop and face the repetitive story,
    the observer part of you has the uncanny ability to help you come back to
    choice and then the replacement thought brings peace.
* Find a new meaning to the word responsibility. Our patterns aren’t our fault
    but it is up to us to clear our pain because blame can keep us stuck for a
    very long time.
* Learn how striving actually hinders and slows down progress. Try harder, do
    better just keeps us stuck.
* Experience real change and drop your old identity.  Through your willingness
    to challenge the mind’s insistence to believe your thoughts, you can learn
    to welcome in your True Self.  Allow me to show you how to give up old
    programs that have stubbornly held you hostage. I look forward to helping
    you enjoy your new-found freedom.
