I {{< img class= "rfloat" src="/img/carol81-240.jpg">}}
have an eclectic background and have studied many modalities during my 30
years in the health field. I'm known for my work with patterns, couples, groups
and individuals.
I help people see the patterns that create a repetitive, and potentialy
destructive cycle. I teach about the patterns we face, and  gently guide you to
replace them, creating a more harmonious existence.
