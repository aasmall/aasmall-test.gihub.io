**Carol Small** has an eclectic background and has studied many modalities
during her 30 years in the health field. She is known for her work with
patterns, her work with couples, groups and individuals.

She has an amazing talent for listening first to the issue described as a
problem and helping people see the pattern creating the repetitive cycle. She
teaches us about the patterns we face, and then gently guides us to face and
replace, creating a more harmonious existence.

> Adding this knowledge to my work with patterns has contributed to helping my
> clients in a much more profound way.
