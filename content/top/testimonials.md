> I have been working with an amazing teacher/counselor.  Her name is Carol and
> she has been a spiritual teacher to a very close friend of mine for many years,
> so I needed to make some very important changes is when I began my work with
> her. Facing yourself has never been so fun.
 
> She works with many modalities, sort of Byron Katie and Sedona Method-Esque and
> Yuan Gong Ren Xue special type of Qi Gong that includes work on clearing and
> changing old programming that keeps circulating and causing problems, and
> probably others have thrown in.  Essentially she is like a laser surgeon for me
> and helps me get right to the root of every problem in my life…she guides me to
> identify, remove, and replace thoughts with trust, openness, love, gratitude,
> and respect.  I can’t say enough about what a difference this help has made in
> my life. K.C.

> Dear Carol, Thank you for a great call dealing with something that I am very
> familiar with. Getting overwhelmed with all there is to do, feeling like I
> should be more productive or accomplish something. Or I am going to get too
> far behind and miss opportunities. I feel guilty for relaxing. I could feel
> the knots in my stomach as I released with the caller that was working. This
> sinking feeling. Then after we did the release I was able to get all neutral
> and realized it was ok. I went to work and it really helped. I stayed calm
> when things could have been a loss. I could see obvious solutions that weren’t
> previously there. Anyway, thank you so much. You are as clear headed and as
> wise as ever. Lots of love

> Carol is a master . . . she’s brilliant at honing in on core issues. She has

> Carol has helped me with her in-depth, eclectic self-exploration which has
> given her the intuition and a laser beam ability to get to the core of a false
> belief that holds destructive patterns in place. She has helped me see with
> crystal clarity the truth of who I really am. This awareness quickly dissolved
> long standing suffering. The same stressful job doesn’t bother me as much; I’m
> less tense and more flexible with change; I am happier and more content. What
> more could you want?

> Carol, thank you for the light you shine into the dark places in such an
> adventurous, fun and completely bearable way
